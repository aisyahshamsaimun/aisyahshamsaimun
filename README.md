👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi there! I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer with hands-on experience in hardware design, firmware development, and system integration. I build reliable, production-ready embedded solutions across power monitoring, security systems, communication interfaces, and custom automation hardware.

My work spans from PCB design and bring-up to bare-metal and RTOS-based firmware, with a strong focus on debugging, optimisation, and maintainability.

🌟 Areas of Expertise
🔧 Embedded Systems & Firmware

Bare-metal programming for PIC microcontrollers

STM32 development (with Zephyr RTOS and LL/HAL)

UART, I²C, SPI, ADC, watchdog, timers, power sequencing

System bring-up, debugging, and production testing

🛠️ Hardware & PCB Design

Power monitoring boards

Access control boards (APC – Wiegand to OSDP converter)

HCB2 Lift controller

Circuit analysis, validation, and troubleshooting

📦 System Software Architecture

Experience designing multi-layer firmware systems:
Application → Manager → Middleware → Driver

Lookup-table driven command/response frameworks

Atomic operations, concurrency handling, async UART pipelines

⚙️ Quality & Reliability

Test automation setups

Production test preparation (PSU, PCB validation)

Robust fault analysis and watchdog handling

🧪 Projects & Work Highlights
🔌 Power Monitoring & Control Systems

Designed and validated hardware + firmware for power measurement and control, including ADC integration, calibration flows, and power-fault handling.

🛡️ Access Control Engineering

Developed APC firmware for converting Wiegand ↔ OSDP protocols and ensuring secure, reliable communication interfaces.

🚀 Zephyr RTOS Development (STM32F756)

Working on a multi-module system involving:

Async UART with FIFO

Maintenance module handling structured commands

Lookup-table driven responses

Atomic-state logic for concurrency-safe operations

🧰 Debugging & System Maintenance

Investigated issues such as partial EEPROM failures, first-boot watchdog toggling bugs, and auto-logout reboot scenarios.

🔍 What I'm Working On

Improving firmware architecture for maintainability and clarity

Deepening Zephyr RTOS knowledge across subsystems

Enhancing robustness of embedded communication pipelines

Expanding testing automation for production hardware
