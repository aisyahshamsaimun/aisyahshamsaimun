# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi there! I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer with a strong foundation in hardware design, firmware development, and system-level engineering. I specialise in building reliable, scalable, and production-ready embedded solutions, from concept and PCB design all the way to firmware architecture and system integration.

I enjoy working across the full embedded stack, designing hardware, writing efficient firmware, integrating communication interfaces, and refining system performance through structured debugging and optimisation.

## 🌟 Areas of Expertise
### 🔧 Embedded Systems Engineering
- Design and development of microcontroller-based systems (PIC, STM32, ARM Cortex-M)
- RTOS and bare-metal firmware for resource-constrained environments
- Low-level driver development, peripheral control, and hardware abstraction
- Real-time constraints analysis, timing-critical logic, and deterministic behavior
- System bring-up, root-cause analysis, and structured embedded debugging

### 🧱 Firmware Architecture & Software Quality

- **Engineered a scalable, layered firmware architecture**  
  (Application → Manager → Middleware → Driver) ensuring modularity and clear separation of concerns  
- **Designed reusable command–response frameworks**  
  enabling structured request handling, extensibility, and consistent response generation across components  
- **Implemented event-driven, asynchronous communication pipelines**  
  for non-blocking data flow, improving throughput and responsiveness in real-time systems  
- **Established concurrency-safe state management**  
  using atomic operations, synchronization primitives, and explicit state machines to guarantee deterministic behavior  
- **Championed software quality practices**  
  emphasizing code clarity, maintainability, and predictable execution in long-running embedded environments  
- **Integrated defensive programming and diagnostic logging**  
  to proactively detect anomalies, simplify debugging, and extend hardware longevity  
- **Promoted scalability and reusability**  
  by abstracting common routines into modular helpers and lookup tables, reducing duplication across boards and sensors
