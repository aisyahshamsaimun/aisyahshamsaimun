# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi there! I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer with a strong foundation in hardware design, firmware development, and system-level engineering. I specialise in building reliable, scalable, and production-ready embedded solutions, from concept and PCB design all the way to firmware architecture and system integration.

I enjoy working across the full embedded stack, designing hardware, writing efficient firmware, integrating communication interfaces, and refining system performance through structured debugging and optimisation.

### 🧱 Firmware Architecture & System-Level Design
- Designed and implemented a layered firmware architecture  
  (Application → Manager → Middleware → Driver) for clear separation of concerns
- Developed modular command-based systems for structured device control
- Built event-driven and asynchronous communication frameworks for responsive operation
- Managed concurrency and system state safely using atomic operations and state machines
- Focused on maintainable, predictable firmware behavior for long-running embedded systems
  
### 🔧 Embedded Application & Device Control
- Developed application-level firmware for device control and system interaction
- Implemented configuration management and persistent storage mechanisms
- Designed a maintenance interface for device monitoring and control over UART
- Integrated power monitoring and system status feedback into application logic
- Bridged hardware-level data with application behavior and system management

### 🛠️ Hardware Design, Bring-Up & Validation
- Designed and developed PCB hardware from schematic capture through layout (excluding fabrication)
- Conducted hardware testing, validation, and systematic issue isolation for new boards
- Led board bring-up activities, including power, clock, and peripheral verification
- Developed bring-up firmware to validate on-board peripherals
- Collaborated closely across hardware and firmware teams to resolve early-stage design issues

### ⚙️ Testing, Automation & Production Support
