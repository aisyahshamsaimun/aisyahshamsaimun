# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi there! I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer with a strong foundation in hardware design, firmware development, and system-level engineering. I specialise in building reliable, scalable, and production-ready embedded solutions, from concept and PCB design all the way to firmware architecture and system integration.

I enjoy working across the full embedded stack, designing hardware, writing efficient firmware, integrating communication interfaces, and refining system performance through structured debugging and optimisation.
